\section{List of Updates to the Physical Model} %%% river nutrient forcing
\label{sec:physUp}
\begin{itemize}
\item Corrected bathymetry aspect ratio
\item Reworked bathymetry to favor water rather than land, based on CHS
data, the Cascadia Data set and a new blended ABC product
\item Stretched the grid to give more resolution in the Fraser River, including all
four arms, and moved all input to the end (upstream of Mission)
\item Changed the partial grid step parametrization so that it is more than half a
grid cell for small near-surface grid cells and more than 2~m for larger grid cells
\item Added a shallow Steveston jetty with elevated bottom friction
\item Changed from UNESCO 1983 to TEOS-10 equation of state, and changed initial conditions and
boundary conditions, rivers to match
\item Changed baroclinic velocity boundary conditions from no-gradient to oblique Orlanksi radiation with a 10-grid cell
sponge layer of 50~m$^2$s$^{-1}$
\item Turned on inverse barometer effect
\item Changed and lengthened geometry of western and northern boundaries to match new bathymetry
\item Changed temperature and salinity at western boundary to LiveOcean boundary conditions
\item Temperature and salinity at northern boundary updated to a climatology provided by Hayley Dosser
\item Matched northern sea surface height to western (Neah Bay) and with a 9.8~cm offset
\item Updated river locations to match new bathymetry
\item Changed river depths so that small rivers all come in at 1~m, medium rivers at 2~m and the Fraser River at 3~m
\item Re-tuned the tides
\item Reduced horizontal eddy diffusivity and viscosity from 10 to 1.5~m$^2$s$^{-1}$
\item Reduced background vertical eddy viscosity from $1\times10^{-5}$ to $1\times10^{-6}$~m$^2$s$^{-1}$
\item Increased friction with land from 0.2 to 0.5 (0 is free slip, 2 is no slip)
\item Corrected for the fact that we partially resolve the log layer in the bottom boundary
\item Decreased the baroclinic/tracer time step to 40~s from 30~s
\item Used vertical advection sub-stepping with 2~s sub-step
\item Changed lateral diffusion from iso-neutral to horizontal so we could use a sponge layer at
the boundaries. Note that iso-neutral has a strict slope limit that we were
mostly hitting anyhow
\item Now accounting for surface currents in wind stress calculation
\item Add SMELT light attenuation based on chlorophyll
\end{itemize}

\section{River Nutrient Forcing.} %%% river nutrient forcing
\label{sec:RivNuts}

River nitrate, ammonium, and dissolved silica from Environment and Climate Change Canada's (EC) online database \cite{dbECRivers} as well as data provided by Debby Ianson (IOS) are summarized in Figure \ref{fig:rivNuts}. 
The Environment Canada data were quoted in grams per liter. 
For dissolved silica, we assumed a molecular weight of 60.08 g mol$^{-1}$, corresponding to SiO$_2$, when converting to molarity, which resulted in values that clustered similarly to the Ianson data.
Subsequently, we were able to confirm that this was the correct conversion for the data type ``Silica Dissolved" (MacDonald, 2019, pers. comm.), but uncertainty remained regarding the units of data labeled ``Silicon Dissolved". These were included in the climatology used to force the model river nutrient inputs because they distributed consistently with the ``Silica Dissolved" measurements. 
In Figure \ref{fig:rivNuts}, we have included only EC data of the type ``Silica Dissolved". 
We re-computed the climatology and constant values based on this slightly reduced dataset after the model run described in this paper had been conducted and found that the change in values in the Fraser River climatology was everywhere less than 5\%, and the constant value for other rivers changed by approximately 7\%. 
The original climatology used in the model run is shown in Figure \ref{fig:rivNuts}.
Similarly, in the nitrate plots in Figure \ref{fig:rivNuts}, we show only EC data of the type ``Nitrogen Dissolved Nitrate", 
whereas the original calculations also included nitrate+nitrite data. 
Re-calculating the climatology with the reduced data set resulted in changes of less than 10\%. 
The original climatology used in the model run is shown. 

The EC data provide valuable temporal resolution of seasonal and interannual variability of nutrient concentrations in several rivers, 
with multi-year data sets at approximately two-week sampling resolution (with many gaps) for the 
Fraser, Quinsam, Cowichan, Tsolum, Englishman, Sumas, Alouette (nitrogen only), and Cheakamus (nitrogen only) Rivers between 1990 and the present. 
The data provided by Debby Ianson include samples from more rivers, but provide sparser temporal resolution. 
All samples were obtained in 2017 and 2018 with only seasonal resolution and were not filtered. 
The Ianson dataset includes samples from the Cowichan, Puntledge, Goldstream (near Victoria), Nanaimo, Englishman, Big Qualicum, 
Fraser, Campbell, Oyster, Trent, Tsable, and Squamish Rivers as well as Rosewall Creek and several creeks in Okeover Inlet. 
Ianson and EC data distribute similarly at most times of year. 
We therefore combined the two datasets for the purposes of calculating river nutrient forcing. 

The daily climatologies of dissolved silica and nitrate concentrations for the largest river in the domain, the Fraser, 
were obtained by smoothing EC observations at the Hope monitoring site temporally (by year day) with a Gaussian kernel with a scale of $\sigma$=25.5 days. 
An average of available ammonia levels from Hope and Gravesend (downstream) was used to estimate Fraser River ammonia. All Fraser River nutrient input in the model occurs near Mission, where the river enters the domain. 

Data from all rivers except the Fraser and Sumas were pooled and averaged to determine constant dissolved silica, nitrate, and ammonia concentrations 
applied to model rivers other than the Fraser. 
The Sumas River was excluded from these calculations due to its unusually high agricultural nutrient load. 
The Sumas River enters the Fraser River between the Hope and Gravesend EC sampling sites, 
but with a mean of only around 3.4~m$^3$s$^{-1}$ based on available EC data, its contribution is negligible compared to the Fraser River discharge ($\approx2700$~m$^3$s$^{-1}$).

\section{SMELT Biological Model Equations}
\label{sec:ModEq}

The biological model is expressed in terms of the reaction-advection-diffusion equation (\ref{eq:RAD}), below.
The model is implemented such that the physical processes of advection and diffusion are handled by NEMO's TOP module, 
while the remaining processes, lumped together as the ``reaction terms", $\mathcal{R}$, are carried out in a biological module we have named SMELT. 
For simplicity and speed of execution, the sinking of biological classes is handled within the biological component rather than being included as an adjustment to the vertical advection calculated by the TOP module.

\begin{align}
 \frac{D\mathbf{x}}{Dt}= \nabla \left(k_d \nabla \mathbf{x} \right) + \mathcal{R}(\mathbf{x},\Theta,I_0)
\label{eq:RAD}
\end{align}

Here, $\mathbf{x}$ is a vector composed of the concentrations of the classes simulated by the biological model: diatoms, small flagellates, \textit{M. rubrum}, microzooplankton, nitrate, ammonium, dissolved silica, particulate organic nitrogen, and dissolved organic nitrogen. 
Concentrations are in units of $\upmu$M N, except for dissolved silica and biogenic silica, which have units of $\upmu$M Si. 
In the equations that follow, we denote individual biological model components by the subscripts defined in Table \ref{tbl:symbols}. 
The left-hand-side of Equation \ref{eq:RAD} is a Lagrangian derivative, encompassing the advective terms. 
$k_d$ is diffusivity. 
Conservative Temperature, $\Theta$, and surface irradiance, $I_0$, 
are provided through coupling to the physical model. 
In the following sections, we present the reaction terms $\mathcal{R}_i$ that govern the evolution of the concentrations of each of the model classes, $x_i$ for each of three class types: living, nutrient, and detrital classes (Table \ref{tbl:symbols}).

\begin{table}[htp]
  \caption{Abbreviations for model classes. 
            Although it is not a freely evolving model component, 
            but rather an externally imposed seasonally varying grazer, 
            mesozooplankton is included.}

   \midrule 
  \end{tabular}
  \end{spacing}
\end{table}

\subsubsection*{Living Classes: Primary Producers and Microzooplankton}

Equation \ref{eq:Living} describes the reaction terms governing the evolution of the living model classes, the diatoms, flagellates, \textit{M. rubrum}, and microzooplankton.
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{R}_i =r_i+\sum_{j}\left(\epsilon^i G_j^i-G_i^j\right)-M_i-E_i-w_s^i \frac{\partial C_i}{\partial z} 
\label{eq:Living}
\end{align}  
Phototrophic growth rate, $r_i$ (Equation \ref{eq:r}), is zero for microzooplankton. 
Growth (or loss if negative) of group $i$ due to grazing is the sum over all living groups $j$ of grazing by $i$ on $j$ times grazing efficiency $\epsilon ^i$ minus any grazing by $j$ on $i$. Grazing rates are defined by Equation \ref{eq:G}, except for grazing by diatoms or flagellates which is zero as they are photoautotrophs.
$M_i$ reflects non-grazing mortality (Equation \ref{eq:M}), and $E_i$ represents egestion/excretion (Equation \ref{eq:E}), which in this model is nonzero for microzooplankton. Its inclusion as a process separate from mortality allows its products to be differently partitioned among the various detrital pools. 
$w_s^i$ is the sinking rate for class $i$ (positive downward and nonzero only for diatoms), $C_i$ is the concentration of class $i$, and $z$ is depth (increasing downward).

\subsubsection*{Nutrients} % NH4, NO3, and dSi
The reaction terms governing nitrate, ammonium, and dissolved silica are given by Equation \ref{eq:Nuts}.
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{R}_i =-\sum_{j}U_i^j+\sum_{k}R_k^i-\sum_{k}R_i^k+P_i
\label{eq:Nuts}
\end{align}  
$U_i^j$ represents uptake of nutrient $i$ by phototrophic class $j$ (Equations \ref{eq:U_NH}--\ref{eq:U_NO}), where the phototrophic classes are diatoms, flagellates, and \textit{M. rubrum}. $R_m^n$ represents remineralization from nutrient or detrital pool $m$ to nutrient pool $n$.
Only $R_{NH}^{NO}$, $R_{DON}^{NH}$, $R_{PON}^{NH}$, and $R_{bSi}^{Si}$ are nonzero (Equations \ref{eq:R_NHNO}--\ref{eq:R_bSiSi}). $P_i$ is production due to other biological processes such as sloppy feeding and mortality (Equation \ref{eq:P}), and the only nutrient class for which $P_i$ is nonzero is ammonium.

\subsubsection*{Detrital Classes}
Equation \ref{eq:Detrital} defines the reaction terms for the detrital classes, dissolved organic nitrogen, particulate organic nitrogen, and biogenic silica. 
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{R}_i =P_i-\sum_jG_i^j-\sum_{k}R_i^k+w_s^i\frac{\partial D_i}{\partial z}
\label{eq:Detrital}
\end{align}
All terms have already been defined. 
Of the detrital classes, particulate organic nitrogen and biogenic silica sink; dissolved organic nitrogen does not.

\subsubsection*{Mesozooplankton}
As in \citeA{MooreMaley2016}, the seasonal cycle of mesozooplankton is implemented as a sum of Gaussian functions centered at three times of year,
\begin{align}
\label{eq:MZbar}
  \bar{Z} = Z_{w} + \sum_{i=1}^3 Z_{i} & \left( \exp[-(t-t_{0i})^2/\sigma _i ^2]  +\exp[-(t+365.25-t_{0i})^2/\sigma _i^2]  \right. \nonumber \\ 
  	        				&  + \left. \exp[-(t-365.25-t_{0i})^2/\sigma _i^2]  \right)
\end{align}
where $Z_w$ is a background winter concentration, and $t$ is year day. 
The $t\pm365.25$ terms are to ensure both sides of the Gaussian tail are captured for peaks centered close to the beginning or end of the year.  
$Z_{i}$, $t_{0i}$, and $\sigma _i$ determine the magnitude, timing, 
and width of the Gaussian peaks representing additional zooplankton growth above the background level. 
We then set the mesozooplankton population to 
\begin{align}
\label{eq:MZ}
   C_{MESZ}(x,y,z,t) = \bar{Z} \frac{F(x,y,z,t)}{\bar{F}_{40}(t)},
\end{align}
where $F$ is the prey abundance at a given location and time, 
equal to the sum of the diatom, flagellate, \textit{M. rubrum}, PON, and microzooplankton classes, 
and $\bar{F}_{40}$ is the average prey over the upper 40 m of the model domain (the depth of the original 1-d model). 
Then, the maximum 40-m average grazing rate is $G_{ref}^{MESZ}=\upsilon_{max}^{MESZ}\bar{Z}$, 
where $\upsilon_{max}^{MESZ}$ is the maximum specific ingestion rate for mesozooplankton (see Equation \ref{eq:G} and Table \ref{tbl:paramsGrazing}).

%%%%%%%%%% Growth %%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Phototrophic Growth}
The rate of phototrophic growth, $r_i$, for diatoms, flagellates, and \textit{M. rubrum}, is determined by the equations below, 
where $\Theta$ is Conservative Temperature in degrees Celsius, 
$I$ is PAR in units of $W m^{-2}$,
$\mathrm{[NH_4]}$ is ammonium concentration in $\upmu$M N, 
$\mathrm{[NO_3]}$ is nitrate concentration in $\upmu$M N, and 
[dSi] is dissolved silica concentration in $\upmu$M Si.
\begin{align}
\label{eq:r}
  r_i &=\begin{cases}
  		\mu_iC_i, & i \in (DIAT, FLAG, MRUB) \\
		0, & i=MICZ 
  	 \end{cases}\\
  \mu_i &=\mu^i_{max}f(\Theta)\hat{L}_i(I,\mathrm{[NH_4^+]},\mathrm{[NO_3^-]},\mathrm{[dSi]}) \\
\end{align}
where $f(\Theta)$ and $\hat{L}_i$ are defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Tdep}
  f(\Theta) = \exp\left[0.07(\Theta-20)\right]\cdot
       \begin{cases}
         1, 				         & \Theta \leq \Theta_{max}-\Theta_{range} \\
    	\frac{\Theta_{max}-\Theta}{\Theta_{range}},      & \Theta_{max}-\Theta_{range}<\Theta<\Theta_{max}\\ 
    	0,      			                   & \Theta \geq \Theta_{max}\\
        \end{cases} 
\end{equation}

\begin{align}
   \hat{L}_i&=\min(L_I^i,L_{Si}^i,L_N^i) \\
   L_I^i&=1.06\exp\left(-\frac{I}{30I_{\text{opt}}^i}\right)\left[1 - \exp\left(-\frac{I}{0.33I_{\text{opt}}^i}\right)\right] \\
   L_{Si}^i &=\frac{[\text{dSi}]}{k_{Si}^i + [\text{dSi}]} \\
   L_N^i &=L_O^i+L_H^i \\
   L_O^i &=\frac{\kappa_i[\text{NO}_{3}^{-}]}{K_N^i + \kappa^i[\text{NO}_{3}^{-}] + [\text{NH}_{4}^{+}]} \\
   L_H^i &=\frac{[\text{NH}_{4}^{+}]}{K_N^i + \kappa^i[\text{NO}_{3}^{-}] + [\text{NH}_{4}^{+}]} 
\end{align} 
Phototrophic growth parameters are listed in Table \ref{tbl:paramsPhoto}.

\subsection*{Nutrient Uptake}
If $\hat{\mu_i}(\Theta)=\mu_{max}^if(\Theta)$, the uptake of nitrogen by phototroph $i$ is given by:
\begin{align}
U_{NH}^i & =
  \begin{cases}
     \hat{\mu_i}(\Theta) \hat{L_i}C_i, & \hat{L}_i\leq L_H \text{ (NH$_{4}^{+}$ replete)}\\
     \hat{\mu_i}(\Theta) L_HC_i, & \hat{L}_i> L_H \text{ (NH$_{4}^{+}$ deficient)}
  \end{cases}  \label{eq:U_NH} \\
U_{NO}^i & =  %%{\text{NO}_{3}^{+}}^i 
  \begin{cases}
     0, & L_H\geq \hat{L}_i \text{ (Si or I limited, NH$_{4}^{+}$ replete)}\\
     \hat{\mu_i}(\Theta) (\hat{L}_i-L_H)C_i, & L_H<\hat{L}_i<L_N \text{ (Si or I limited, NH$_{4}^{+}$ deficient)}\\
     \hat{\mu_i}(\Theta) L_OC_i, & L_N\leq \min(L_I,L_{Si}) \text{ (N limited)}\\
  \end{cases} \label{eq:U_NO}
\end{align}
The rate of uptake of dissolved silica by biological class $i$ is simply:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:U_Si}
  U_{\mathrm{Si}}^i = a_{\mathrm{Si:N}}^i r_i
\end{align}
where $a_{Si:N}^i$ is the ratio of silicon to nitrogen in biological class $i$ (Table \ref{tbl:paramsPhoto}). $a_{Si:N}^i$ is only nonzero for diatoms. 

\subsection*{Grazing}

Grazing by class $i$ on class $j$, $G_j^i$, is parameterized by equation \ref{eq:G}, which includes grazing thresholds, prey preferences, and the possibility for limitation based both on total and individual prey concentrations. 
\begin{align}
\label{eq:G}
   G_j^i & = \upsilon_{max}^i C_i \cdot  \max\left( \min(\Gamma_j^i,\hat{\Gamma}_j^i),0\right) \\
    \Gamma_j^i & = \frac{\rho_j^iC_j}{\sum_j\rho_j^iC_j} \cdot \frac{C_j-\alpha_j^i}{K_j^i+C_j-\alpha_j^i} \\
    \hat{\Gamma}_j^i & =  \frac{\sum_jC_j-\alpha^i}{K^i+\sum_jC_j-\alpha^i} 
\end{align}
where $\rho_j^i$ are fractions so that $\sum_j \rho_j^i = 1$. 
Since \textit{M. rubrum} only grazes on the flagellate class, $\Gamma_j^i$ and $\hat{\Gamma}_j^i$ reduce to the same equation and therefore only $\hat{\Gamma}_j^i$ is calculated. 
The grazers, $i$, include the parameterized mesozooplankton (Equation \ref{eq:MZ}) as well as the microzooplankton and flagellate classes. 
Grazing parameter values are presented in Table \ref{tbl:paramsGrazing}.
 
\subsection*{Other Mortality and Excretion/Egestion}

\begin{align}
  M_i & = m_i C_i h(\Theta) \label{eq:M} \\
  E_i & = e_i C_i h(\Theta) \label{eq:E}\\
  h(\Theta) & = \exp\left[ 0.07 (\Theta-20.0^{\circ}\textrm{C}) \right] \label{eq:h}
\end{align}
Mortality and Excretion/Egestion parameter values are shown in Table \ref{tbl:Mort}.

\subsection*{Remineralization}

\begin{align}
R_{\textrm{NH}}^{\textrm{NO}} &= b_{\textrm{NH}}^{\textrm{NO}} h(\Theta)  \mathrm{[NH_4^+]}^2 \label{eq:R_NHNO} \\
R_{\textrm{DON}}^{\textrm{NH}} &= b_{\textrm{DON}}^{\textrm{NH}} h(\Theta) \mathrm{[DON]}  \label{eq:R_DONNH} \\
R_{\textrm{PON}}^{\textrm{NH}} &= b_{\textrm{PON}}^{\textrm{NH}} h(\Theta) \mathrm{[PON]} \label{eq:R_PONNH} \\
R_{\textrm{bSi}}^{\textrm{dSi}} &= b_{\textrm{bSi}}^{\textrm{dSi}} h(\Theta) \mathrm{[bSi]} \label{eq:R_bSiSi}
\end{align}
Remineralization parameter values are listed in Table \ref{tbl:Remin}.

\subsection*{Transfer to Detrital Pools}
The processes that transfer material from living classes to the detrital nitrogen and ammonium pools are sloppy feeding (in terms of grazing efficiency), mortality, and excretion/egestion. 
\begin{align}
\label{eq:P}
   P_i = \sum_j\sum_k\chi_{j\rightarrow k}^i(1-\epsilon^k)G_j^k + \sum_j\chi_{j\rightarrow M}^i M_j +\sum_j\chi_{j\rightarrow E}^i E_j
\end{align}
subject to:
\begin{align}
   \sum_i \chi_{j\rightarrow k}^i \le 1
\end{align}
where $i$ can be ammonium, DON, or PON.
When the sum of the grazing transfer fractions is less than one, it signifies that some of the nitrogen is transferred to a ``refractory" pool and is in effect removed from the model. 
Transfer to the ``refractory" pool, burial, and flow out of the boundaries are the mechanisms by which nitrogen can be lost from the system. 

All detrital silicon is combined in a single biogenic silica pool. The amount that is transferred depends on the silicon to nitrogen ratio in the source class. Here, the only source class with nonzero Si:N ratio is the diatoms ($a_{\mathrm{Si:N}}^{DIAT}$). 
\begin{align}
   P_{bSi} & = a_{\mathrm{Si:N}}^j G_j^{bSi}+a_{\mathrm{Si:N}}^j M_j+a_{\mathrm{Si:N}}^j E_j \\
              & = a_{\mathrm{Si:N}}^{DIAT} G_{DIAT}^{bSi}+a_{\mathrm{Si:N}}^{DIAT} M_{DIAT}
\end{align}

\subsection*{Sinking Rate}
The diatom sinking rate is parameterized as a function of nutrient limitation, by equation \ref{eq:diatSink}.
\begin{align}
\label{eq:diatSink}
   w_s^{DIAT} =  w_{s\mathrm{min}}^{DIAT} \min(L_N^i, L_{Si}^i)^{0.2} + w_{s\mathrm{max}}^{DIAT} (1 -  \min(L_N^i, L_{Si}^i)^{0.2})
\end{align}
Particulate organic nitrogen and biogenic silica sinking rates are constant, except for the bottom cell where the outward flux is adjusted according to a reflection parameter $\alpha_b$ as described in Section \ref{sec:BB}.
Parameter values associated with sinking are listed in Table \ref{tbl:SinkBBC}.

% Single-line equations are centered.

Math coded inside display math mode \[ ...\]
 will not be numbered, e.g.,:

 Math coded inside \begin{equation} and \end{equation} will
 be automatically numbered, e.g.,:
 \begin{equation}
 x^2=y^2 + z^2
 \end{equation}

% IF YOU HAVE MULTI-LINE EQUATIONS, PLEASE
% BREAK THE EQUATIONS INTO TWO OR MORE LINES
% OF SINGLE COLUMN WIDTH (20 pc, 8.3 cm)
% using double backslashes (\\).

% To create multiline equations, use the
% \begin{eqnarray} and \end{eqnarray} environment
% as demonstrated below.
\begin{eqnarray}
  x_{1} & = & (x - x_{0}) \cos \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \sin \Theta  \nonumber \\
  y_{1} & = & -(x - x_{0}) \sin \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \cos \Theta.
\end{eqnarray}

%If you don't want an equation number, use the star form:
%\begin{eqnarray*}...\end{eqnarray*}

% Break each line at a sign of operation
% (+, -, etc.) if possible, with the sign of operation
% on the new line.

% Indent second and subsequent lines to align with
% the first character following the equal sign on the
% first line.

% Use an \hspace{} command to insert horizontal space
% into your equation if necessary. Place an appropriate
% unit of measure between the curly braces, e.g.
% \hspace{1in}; you may have to experiment to achieve
% the correct amount of space.

%
%  EQUATION NUMBERING: COUNTER
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% You may change equation numbering by resetting
% the equation counter or by explicitly numbering
% an equation.

% To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
% (with the desired number between the brackets)
% after the \begin{equation} or \begin{eqnarray}
% command.  The \eqnum{} command will affect only
% the equation it appears with; LaTeX will number
% any equations appearing later in the manuscript
% according to the equation counter.
%

% If you have a multiline equation that needs only
% one equation number, use a \nonumber command in
% front of the double backslashes (\\) as shown in
% the multiline equation above.
